# Erlang port driver for nfc using libnfc

This driver is initially intended to allow erlang programs to access nfc readers by providing basic access to libnfc functions.

The initial version will be focused on simply identifying nfc tags. More general bi-directional comms between nfc devices and storing data on remote nfc devices is something that I may do later.
